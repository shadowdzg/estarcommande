# Socket.IO Deployment Request for Backend Team

## Issue Summary
The frontend Flutter app is ready to use Socket.IO for real-time updates, but the server at `estcommand.ddns.net:8080` doesn't have Socket.IO endpoints available yet.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Frontend**: Socket.IO client implementation complete and ready
- ❌ **Backend**: Socket.IO endpoints return 404 (not deployed)
- ✅ **Documentation**: WebSocket API guide exists and looks complete

## Test Results
```bash
# Socket.IO endpoint test
curl "http://estcommand.ddns.net:8080/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling"
# Returns: {"message":"Cannot GET /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling","error":"Not Found","statusCode":404}

# Regular API endpoints work fine
curl "http://estcommand.ddns.net:8080/api/v1/auth/login" -X POST
# Returns: Expected authentication response
```

## What We Need
Please deploy the Socket.IO implementation to `estcommand.ddns.net:8080` that matches the WebSocket API guide you provided.

### Required Dependencies
```bash
npm install socket.io @nestjs/websockets @nestjs/platform-socket.io
```

### Required Endpoints
The server should respond to these Socket.IO endpoints:
- `GET /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling` (Socket.IO handshake)
- WebSocket upgrade support for `/socket.io/` path

### Expected Events (from your API guide)
**Client to Server:**
- `getCommands` - One-time data fetch
- `subscribeToCommands` - Subscribe to real-time updates  
- `unsubscribeFromCommands` - Unsubscribe from updates

**Server to Client:**
- `commandsData` - Data response with `{data: [...], totalCount: 123}` format
- `commandUpdated` - Real-time updates with `{action: 'created/updated/deleted', commandId: '...', data: {...}}`
- `subscriptionConfirmed` - Subscription acknowledgment
- `unsubscriptionConfirmed` - Unsubscription acknowledgment

### Authentication
- JWT token in connection auth: `auth: { token: 'jwt-token' }`
- Same authentication as HTTP API endpoints

## Frontend Implementation Status
✅ **Ready and waiting!** The Flutter app will automatically connect and work once Socket.IO is deployed.

Current debug output shows:
```
DEBUG: Socket.IO connection error: WebSocketException: Connection to 'http://estcommand.ddns.net:8080/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket#' was not upgraded to websocket, HTTP status code: 404
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy Socket.IO implementation to production server
2. Verify `/socket.io/` endpoint responds correctly
3. Test WebSocket upgrade functionality
4. Confirm JWT authentication works with Socket.IO

## Questions for Backend Team
1. Is the Socket.IO implementation ready in your codebase?
2. When can it be deployed to `estcommand.ddns.net:8080`?
3. Are there any proxy/nginx configurations needed for WebSocket support?

## Contact
Let me know once Socket.IO is deployed so I can test the connection from the Flutter app.

**Priority**: Medium - Real-time features are waiting on this deployment
**Impact**: Frontend real-time updates currently disabled until Socket.IO is available
